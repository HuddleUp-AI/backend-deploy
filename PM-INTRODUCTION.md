# PaletAI Backend Migration - Product Manager's Guide

**A non-technical overview of our Azure infrastructure migration and cost optimization project**

---

## üéØ What This Project Does

This repository contains everything needed to move our PaletAI Backend application from our current Azure account to a new one, while also significantly reducing our monthly cloud hosting costs.

**Think of it like:** Moving your office to a new building with a better lease, while also downsizing to a more appropriately-sized space that still meets all your needs.

## üí° Why We're Doing This

### Primary Reasons

1. **Account Migration Requirement**
   - Our current Azure subscription is being discontinued
   - We need to move to a new Azure tenant (think: a new account with a different organization)
   - This migration must happen before the old account closes

2. **Cost Optimization Opportunity**
   - Our current setup costs **$70-100/month**
   - Investigation showed we're over-provisioned (paying for resources we don't fully use)
   - New setup will cost **$15-16/month**
   - **Annual savings: $660-$1,020** (70-85% reduction)

3. **Infrastructure Modernization**
   - Old setup was configured ad-hoc over time
   - New setup uses "Infrastructure as Code" (automated, repeatable setup)
   - Easier to recreate if needed in the future
   - Better documentation and maintainability

## üí∞ Business Value

### Cost Savings Breakdown

| Item | Current | New | Savings |
|------|---------|-----|---------|
| **App Server** | ~$70-100/month | $13/month | ~$60-85/month |
| **File Storage** | Included | ~$1-2/month | Minimal |
| **Monitoring** | Included | Free (5GB tier) | $0 |
| **Total Monthly** | $70-100 | $15-16 | **$55-85** |
| **Total Annual** | $840-1,200 | $180-192 | **$660-1,020** |

**ROI:** The time invested in this migration pays for itself in saved hosting costs within 2-3 months.

### Performance Impact

**Good news:** Despite the cost reduction, performance remains the same or better:
- Current setup: 1 CPU core, 1.75GB memory
- New setup: 1 CPU core, 1.75GB memory (identical)
- Same response times
- Same capacity
- Same reliability

**Why the savings?** We're moving to a more cost-effective pricing tier that still provides everything we need.

## üìÖ Timeline & Effort

## üîç What You Need to Know / Decide

### Decisions for PM

1. **Migration Timing**
   - **Question:** When should we do this?
   - **Recommendation:** During low-traffic hours (e.g., late evening or weekend)
   - **Constraint:** Must happen before old Azure account closes
   - **Your Decision:** Pick a date/time that works for the team

2. **User Communication**
   - **Question:** Do we need to notify users of potential downtime?
   - **Recommendation:**
     - If using zero-downtime strategy: No notification needed
     - If brief downtime expected: Send advance notice (15 minutes expected)
   - **Your Decision:** How do you want to communicate (if at all)?

3. **Monitoring Period**
   - **Question:** How long should we keep the old environment as backup?
   - **Recommendation:** 7-30 days after successful migration
   - **Cost Impact:** Old environment costs money while kept running
   - **Your Decision:** Preferred backup period

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - **Question:** What level of testing before go-live?
   - **Options:**
     - Quick smoke test (~10 minutes) - Basic functionality check
     - Thorough testing (~30 minutes) - Full feature verification
     - Full QA regression (~2 hours) - Complete test suite
   - **Your Decision:** Testing depth vs. time trade-off

### Information You'll Need to Provide

- **New Azure Account Details:**
  - Tenant ID (provided by Azure admin)
  - Subscription ID (provided by Azure admin)
  - Confirmation that team has proper access

- **AI Provider Preference:**
  - OpenAI (current)
  - Azure OpenAI (alternative)
  - Anthropic Claude (alternative)
  - **Note:** This affects which API keys are needed

- **Custom Domain (if applicable):**
  - Do we have a custom domain pointing to the API? (e.g., api.paletai.com)
  - If yes, we'll need DNS access to update it

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Database Connection Issues
**Risk Level:** Low
**Impact:** Application can't access data
**Mitigation:** We test database connectivity before cutover
**Rollback:** Takes 5 minutes to point back to old environment

### Risk 2: DNS Propagation Delays
**Risk Level:** Low
**Impact:** Some users may see old site for 5-60 minutes
**Mitigation:** Lower DNS TTL before migration
**Rollback:** Point DNS back to old environment

### Risk 3: Unexpected Application Errors
**Risk Level:** Very Low
**Impact:** Application features don't work as expected
**Mitigation:** Thorough testing before user cutover
**Rollback:** Switch back to old environment immediately

### Risk 4: Performance Degradation
**Risk Level:** Very Low (same resources as current)
**Impact:** Slow response times
**Mitigation:** Load testing before migration, monitoring after
**Rollback:** Switch back to old environment, investigate issue

### Overall Risk Assessment

## ü§î Common Questions (FAQ)

### "Will users notice anything different?"
**No.** The application looks and works exactly the same. We're just changing where the code runs behind the scenes.

### "Why don't we do this more often to save money?"
**Good question!** We actually can't save more - we're already at the minimum tier that provides the features we need (like "always on" functionality). Going cheaper would lose critical features.

### "What if something breaks?"
**We can switch back in ~5 minutes.** The old environment stays running for 7-30 days as backup, so we have plenty of safety margin.

### "Do we need to tell our customers?"
**Depends on your preference.** Technically no, since impact should be zero. But some companies prefer proactive transparency. Your call.

### "How much technical debt are we taking on?"
**Actually reducing it!** The new setup uses modern "Infrastructure as Code" practices, making it easier to maintain, reproduce, and document. This is an upgrade in technical maturity.

### "Can we scale up if we grow?"
**Absolutely!** Scaling is a single command and takes ~2 minutes. We can go from $13/month (current plan) to $26/month (double resources) instantly if needed. There's a clear upgrade path all the way to enterprise tier.

### "What happens if the engineer who does this leaves?"
**Everything is documented.** This repository contains complete step-by-step guides, checklists, and automated scripts. Any DevOps engineer with basic Azure experience can maintain this going forward.

### "Is this a one-time cost savings or permanent?"
**Permanent!** The $55-85/month savings continues every month as long as our traffic remains at current levels.
